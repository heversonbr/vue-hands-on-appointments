# Vue.js Hands-on 

This is just a sketch app for Managing Appointments in a public office. 

It is thougth as a panel that is shown to the public (through a large screen) and it is used to call people to be receveid by a public agent.
It is just as a simple use-case for making a hands-on of Vue.js. 

Remind: it does not use a real database. Random users are taken from https://randomuser.me. 

Just use `npm run serve` to run it.
